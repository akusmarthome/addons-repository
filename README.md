# Home Assistant Add-ons repository

## About

This repository exists mainly because I needed to upgrade [Marcio's NightScout addon](https://github.com/marciogranzotto/addon-nightscout) and [Ivo Hlavaty](https://github.com/i-cz/addon-nightscout) for Home Assistant and I wanted to have multiple instances.

This serves solely for my personal usage so if you would like to reuse I recommend to fork or copy&paste the code because there will be unannounced updates or breaking changes.

## Installation
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1.  [Add our Home Assistant add-ons repository][repository] to your Home Assistant instance.
2.  Install the "Nightscout XYZ" add-on.
3.  Change the configuration files with the required values.
4.  Start the "Nightscout" add-on
5.  Check the logs of the "Nightscout" add-on to see if everything went well.
6.  Click "OPEN WEB UI" to open the Nightscout website.
7.  Log in with your `api_key`.
